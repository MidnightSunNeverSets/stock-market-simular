# Stock Market Simulator

## Project Proposal

***Investing is only fun when you YOLO it! :D***

The purpose of this application is to simulate some of the trading conditions one might encounter in the actual 
stock market. Through a virtual market environment, all with its own fake companies and equities, players
interested in learning more about the market, or just for their own entertainment, will be able to trade stocks
and have fun with their trading methods without actually running financial risk. 

As someone with very little prior interest in investing, I view this project as a way for me learn more about the stock 
market. When it comes to money, my knowledge of finances, and really anything involving the economy, is quite lacking. 
Therefore, by basing the project around the stock exchange, I will be forced to put in the necessary research to 
understand its terminology and mechanics. Moreover, in light of the recent GME trading mania, I've also realized that 
I've always wanted to experience the thrill of betting one's life savings on high-risk trades and losing everything, 
but without the parts involving actual financial ruin.
